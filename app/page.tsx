<b>Solving a challenge</b>
<br />
<p>As mentioned previously, I am/was the main point of contact of billing tickets in my current role. 
  A customer reached out to us with a mostly simple flat renewal of their subscription. I was dealing with the request as usual,
  following our usual guidlines, while the billing engineering team was implementing new changes in the process. 
  The customer&apos;s new invoice failed in the system, which meant that their subscription straight away was cancelled. 
  This situation required prompt response from the whole team&apos;s end to put back on track this customer. Fortunately we couldoffer them
  an even better subscription so they left with smile on their face.

<b>Choosing Vercel Functions</b>
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Edge Functions: Use for low-latency and high-performance scenarios, such as content personalization, A/B testing, or real-time updates, as they run closer to the end-user.</li>
  <li>Serverless Functions:Ideal for backend operations, like handling form submissions, processing payments, or interacting with databases, where execution time and resource usage are variable.</li>
  <li>Edge Middleware:Best for request/response manipulation, authentication, and routing logic, allowing for complex logic to be executed at the edge before reaching the backend.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<br />

  <br />

      <b>Redirecting a path</b>
      <br />
      <p>
      Dear Customer,
To redirect the /blog path to https://example.com, you can add a redirect rule in your vercel.json configuration file. Here&apos;s how you can do it:

This configuration will create a permanent redirect from /blog to https://example.com.

<b>Preventing Indexing</b>
<p>To prevent your project from being indexed by search engines, you can add a robots.txt file to your project&apos;s root directory with the following content:
makefile
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
This will instruct search engines not to index any pages of your site.
Additionally, you can include the following meta tag in the head section of your HTML documents to prevent indexing:



This combination will help ensure that your site remains unindexed.
If you need further assistance, feel free to ask.
